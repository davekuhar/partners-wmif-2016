The mission of Partners clinicians and researchers to provide the best care for patients drives a continuous dialogue on what state-of-the-art medical technologies are just over the horizon. The Disruptive Dozen was created to identify and rank the most disruptive technologies that Partners leading faculty feel will break through over the next decade in cancer care.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Nomination Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Beginning November 2015 and through January 2016, 42 30-minute in-person and telephone interviews were conducted with leading faculty from Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute to elicit their nominations of the technologies they believe will have the greatest impact on oncological care at any point in the next decade. The interviews resulted in 34 nominated technologies that varied from the broad in scope to quite specific.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selection Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>12-15 leading Partners faculty gathered in February to form a committee of \u201cselectors\u201d to jointly choose and rank the final 12 technologies. Drs. Daniel Haber and Monica Bertagnolli served as selection committee moderators and were supported by Partners Innovation staff. To receive consideration for the final Disruptive Dozen, nominated technologies had to meet the following criteria:<\/p>\n<p>Criteria 1<br \/>\nThe innovation had to have the strong potential for significant onco-related clinical impact at some point in the next decade and offer significant patient benefit in comparison to current practices. The innovation may also have had a significant benefit to<br \/>\nthe delivery\/efficiency of oncologic related health care.<\/p>\n<p>Criteria 2<br \/>\nNominated oncologic-related innovations had to have a high probability of successful commercial deployment\u2014e.g., payers will be expected to support it.<\/p>\n<p>Criteria 3<br \/>\nThe innovation must be on the market sometime before April 2026. Ideally, the final group selected would involve a blend of disruptive technologies coming to market in the next three to four years as well as ones that will come to market later in the decade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Selection Ranking Process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Round 1<br \/>\nThe initial pass of the 34 nominations by the selection committee eliminated all technologies that didn\u2019t meet the criteria or didn\u2019t<br \/>\nhave a realistic potential of being ranked in the top 15. The moderators named each technology and asked panel members to vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to move the technology to the next round. One \u201cyes\u201d vote is enough to advance the technology.<\/p>\n<p>Round 2<br \/>\nThe moderators described the candidate technology, pointing out salient points, and then asked for comments from committee<br \/>\nmembers. After a discussion of the pros and cons of the technology, panel members voted A, B, or C with a raise of the<br \/>\nhand. Innovation staff recorded the voting.<\/p>\n<p>A. It\u2019s highly probable that the technology will significantly influence oncology care before 2026.<br \/>\nB. It\u2019s probable that the technology will significantly influence oncology care before 2026.<br \/>\nC. It\u2019s not likely that the technology will significantly influence oncology care before 2026.<\/p>\n<p>Round 3<br \/>\nEach surviving technology earned a score with overall rank tied to the size of the score\u2014i.e., the higher the score, the better. Innovation staff reported this initial ranking of all technologies.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Final Scores and Announcement<\/strong><br \/>\nSelection committee members jointly ranked the innovations from 1 to 12 using the initial scoring and further discussion. The selection committee ranking was final and will be announced April 27, 2016 in a one-hour panel at the World Medical Innovation Forum. The session will be moderated by Monica Bertagnolli, MD, and Daniel Haber, MD, PhD, and feature 12 faculty members selected to briefly comment on each technology.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>2015 | Neuroscience\u00a0Disruptive Dozen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/worldmedicalinnovation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1496\" src=\"http:\/\/worldmedicalinnovation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2.jpg\" alt=\"Disruptive Dozen | 2015\" width=\"200\" height=\"259\" srcset=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2.jpg 200w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2-77x100.jpg 77w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2-62x80.jpg 62w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Partners-D12-COVER-2-48x62.jpg 48w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Click here to read the complete list of 2015 Disruptive Dozen.<\/p>\n<p>The culture of innovation at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, McLean Hospital and Spaulding Rehabilitation Network \u2013 throughout all of Partners HealthCare &#8212; naturally fosters a good deal of discussion about new \u201cdisruptive\u201d technologies and which ones will have the biggest impact.
