The novel concept of treating patients before they are symptomatic<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Instead of waiting until patients develop full blown Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the A4 study has been proactive. The A4 study targets older individuals with evidence of early Alzheimer\u2019s changes in their brain but who do not yet have symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, in hopes of preventing memory decline. This is the first time in history of AD research that a prevention trial has been undertaken in asymptomatic individuals identified with biomarker evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. The use of an anti-amyloid antibody<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The humanized monoclonal antibody, solanezumab, which has already be testing in two Phase 3 trials at the stage of Alzheimers\u2019 dementia, binds to soluble forms of amyloid and can help its clearance of it from the brain. The previous trials in dementia patients showed some modest evidence of slowing of decline in the mildest subgroup. The hope is treating 5-10 years earlier with this antibody can bend the curve of decline.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. It\u2019s empowering patients to manage their health and potential risk for developing AD<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The A4 study has made people more aware of options for treatment and potential cures in the works. Alzheimer&#8217;s disease is not a death sentence and clinicians and researchers are working hard through this trial and other to get closer to finding a cure.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4.It\u2019s getting people talking about Alzheimer\u2019s disease (more people learning about what Alzheimer\u2019s actually is, informing families at risk, communities, etc.)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Almost everyone knows someone, or has a friend who has known someone affected by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. More and more people are hearing the words \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s disease\u201d in conversation but do not exactly know what it means. These trials are giving the disease much more press, and increasing awareness. This is beneficial in many aspects such as fundraising for research and recruiting people for this study.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. It involves collaborations<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The A4 trial is sponsored by a public-private partnership involving the National Institutes of Health, Eli Lilly, and several philanthropic organizations. The A4 study is also working with other prevention trial efforts in genetic at-risk populations around the world to ensure they can learn as much as possible from these trials.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. It emphasizes its urgency<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most people are not aware of the urgency of action for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. One of nine people over the age of 65 has the disease, and as our population ages, Alzheimer\u2019s disease is becoming a public health epidemic. If we do not do something about it, this disease has the potential to bankrupt our healthcare system. It is critical to increase awareness and send the message something that can be done to cure Alzheimer\u2019s if we act now.
