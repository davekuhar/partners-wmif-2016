Topics ranged from psychiatric care to information systems and how they all can contribute to innovation in the neurosciences. Rich, interdisciplinary discussion flowed among clinicians, industry experts, policymakers, and researchers. The Discovery Cafe provided a platform to transform mingling and networking into purposeful interaction between fellow attendees.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1488\" src=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome - 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-150x100.jpg 150w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-120x80.jpg 120w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6396-93x62.jpg 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Attendees were officially ushered into their upcoming three days of neurological innovation by CEO of Partners HealthCare, David Torchiana, M.D., and Chief Academic Officer of Partners HealthCare, Anne Klibanski, M.D., as well as by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. A significant fraction of Partners HealthCare\u2019s $1.5 billion enterprise is work in the neurosciences. The audience was called to action to push the frontiers of medicine against the backdrop of world-renowned facilities, scientists, and clinicians that is Boston.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Neurocare, Neuromarkets, and Neuro Challenges <\/strong><br \/>\nThe day\u2019s first panel, \u201cNeurocare, Neuromarkets, and Neuro Challenges,\u201d cited early detection and prophylactic care as key needs across Alzheimer\u2019s and psychiatric care. Scott Rauch, President and Psychiatrist in Chief at McLean Hospital, stated it\u2019s the rule rather than the exception that patients are suffering from psychiatric diseases for years before they are detected. These observations, however, were tempered amidst real-world reservations from patients, who may not want to know about genetic predispositions or had privacy concerns amidst proposals for earlier screening and detection.<\/p>\n<p>Clinical neuroscience leaders across Partners HealthCare were called to dive into the past, present, and future of diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) to share how far we have come in the field and how very much there is still left to discover. A common thread throughout was that stigma is stalling. The medicalization of psychiatric illnesses has been a remarkable jump forward &#8211; clinicians are now viewing bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, etc., as diseases with an originating pathology like how we view hypertension or diabetes. We are now seeing the beginning of stigma erosion in public figures and celebrities stepping forward to advocate for these illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>With this new clinical perspective comes the challenge of screening. When will AD be uniformly screened, like colon cancer? To reach patients at the primary care level is key to early intervention. It is widely understood now that changes in the brain due to AD occur decades before symptoms first appear. Engaging at-risk patients earlier and understanding how inflammation in the immune system contributes to its spread will be of note in the future of AD care.<\/p>\n<p>In neurosurgery, advances are more technical but no less exciting. There is more precision than ever before in imaging and in the miniaturization of instruments. Gels and focused ultrasounds are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver the appropriate amount of drugs to a specific location in the brain. These advances contribute to the minimization of collateral brain damage during surgery. As neurosurgery becomes safer and more seamless, we will see patients with better outcomes.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are we able to enter the brain with newfound surgical specificity, but we are also now at the advent of specificity in neurogenetics. The future of neurocare will be linking outcomes and treatments to the genotypes of patients. Researchers are beginning to acknowledge the overlap that many of these neurodegenerative diseases share in similar genetic predispositions. This can be translated into clinical trial design by finding out how successful patients are different genetically and then designing the next trial based on that data. Lowering the burden of becoming involved in clinical trials is key to the advancement of research. Another challenge to neurocare is how to expand access to treatment. Telemedicine plays a big role with programs such as cognitive behavioral therapy being available online. Our personal devices like phones and tablets hold the answer to remote monitoring. It is how we contextualize this deluge of \u201cbig data\u201d that will shape the trajectory of the neuromarket in upcoming years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>\u201cOver the Horizon: Witnessing Disruption of Neurocare\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1489\" src=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"Over the Horizon - 1\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-300x200.jpg 300w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-768x512.jpg 768w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-1024x683.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-150x100.jpg 150w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-120x80.jpg 120w, http:\/\/medforum16.sitedistrict.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/5H8A6594-93x62.jpg 93w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a><br \/>\nThe day\u2019s second panel, \u201cOver the Horizon: Witnessing the Disruption of Neurocare,\u201d generated bold predictions across industry and public research organizations, proposing an array of traditional therapeutics, electroceutical, brain-machine interface approaches to treat human disease and augment lifestyles, even repositioning the nervous system as the vehicle to deliver and refine treatment for patients. As Geoffrey Ling, Director of Biological Technologies Office at DARPA pointed out, experiments highlighting cognitive control of prosthetic limbs point to a potential applications that could surpass the limits of our sensory organs and other exogenous tools to improve patient cognition and lifestyles, especially in states of frailty observed later in life.<\/p>\n<p>This provocative panel leapt into novel ideas that the panelists believe are just at the cusp of neurological innovation. These neuro-forecasters pooled their collective knowledge from biotechnology and big pharma to present the most cutting-edge and controversial of work. The audience was advised to abandon any preconceived notions on how innovation works, citing that humans did not know that cell phones would be so ingrained into our lifestyle a decade ago. Panelists pushed that in the future of the patient-empowered age, everyone will be sequencing their genome, even from birth. The best drugs will then be gene-modifiers, and the concept of a \u201cdrug\u201d could completely vanish as combined strategies make their way into therapeutics and care plans. Clinicians will soon be prescribing drugs with apps or drugs with software. The concept of a \u201cdose\u201d will change as we add different interfaces into neurocare.<\/p>\n<p>One of these novel \u201cneural interfaces\u201d is the concept of \u201celectroceuticals,\u201d or devices that deliver electrical stimulation at the level of peripheral nerves. These exquisitely specific devices will be smaller than a grain of rice and allow us to control our neurocircuitry. It is up to investigators of the future to map the neurocircuitry of diseases. The concept that the central nervous system is synergistic with pathology throughout the body is one that may be difficult for clinicians to adapt to. For example, it is clear that diabetes is a metabolic disorder but how clear is it that it is a neurological one? Imagine the possibility of treating an illness with \u201cinformation\u201d in addition to drugs.<\/p>\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) may be characteristic of science fiction movies, but is nothing to fear, but rather embrace. The Stone Age and Iron Age were eras of tool adaptation, and so the expected path is that the Digital Age will move onto AI as we \u201cadapt\u201d to the synergy of brain and machine. By doing this, we are \u201cliberating our bodies\u201d and allowing our cognitive capacity to accomplish more. Our future lies in the \u201cInternet of things,\u201d or rather than having exogenous control in the form of cellphones, tablets, etc., we will have internal cognitive control over our environment. This is not a new concept; brain-controlled prosthetics are allowing amputees to control limbs. Phones and computers may be a thing of the past one day, and \u201csmart\u201d environments will take their place.<\/p>\n<p>Along with enhancing our environments, enhancing the normal human condition is pushing the frontiers of medicine. Becoming bionic may mean unprecedented longevity for today\u2019s youth. To achieve this. we must understand what is the \u201caverage\u201d condition and why is it that we age and become ill. Have our genes not adapted to today\u2019s environment and lifestyle? If so, perhaps we can identify those genes that cause disease and aging and \u201cturn them off.\u201d Ethical issues will be an obstacle to many of these radical ideas and must be addressed before becoming mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>So, what must happen in order for these concepts to be implemented in the clinical setting? Building the technological platforms and understanding the revolutionary biology must happen simultaneously. Industry stakeholders have to own this work in order for it to make it into practice. As the population grows older, public pressure mounts with the heavy societal burdens of neurological disease.<\/p>\n<p>For both the research and innovation communities, key challenges and questions arise: Why is therapeutic development usually a second career? Why is it not viewed more urgently in the minds of clinicians? What barriers are holding them back from tapping into this rich field? For innovators trying to propel disruptive interventions like electroceuticals into the care space, what will it take for consumers and patients to choose devices over drugs? IUDs and implants prove to be the most effective contraceptive method, yet pills are the most widely preferred method today. Will the idea of \u201cinvasiveness\u201d change over time as the body interacts more with technology?<\/p>\n<p>Only time can answer these pressing questions on the minds of today\u2019s innovators and researchers. Biology is becoming more of a quantitative science. \u201cCoding\u201d our nerves and gene editing has the potential to become a universal standard of treatment. \u201cCognitive resilience,\u201d or the fielding of symptoms of AD, for example, can become a reality and greatly impact the quality of life of patients. At the intersection of therapeutics and technology lie a wealth of knowledge that we do not yet know how to harvest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transformation and Innovation: Conflict? Collision?

As Jeff Leiden, M.D., Ph.D., CEO of Vertex, noted, the irony is that the science has never been better, but the funding has never been worse.<\/p>\n<p>While undertones in funding and an increasingly difficult operating environment where apparent throughout the day, the panelists shared a universal optimism for the current state of medicine and an excitement in the potential advances to come, often pointing to current market forces as motivators for improvements in treatment and care. As Leiden noted, the health care community has a great story to tell when it comes to the value and impact that the system brings to society; we just need to focus on communicating that story to the public.<\/p>\n<p>Posted by Angelica Recierdo, Thomas Martz, and Alessandra Maahs<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Partners HealthCare kicked off its inaugural World Medical Innovation Forum in Boston on April 27 with a truly international presence, bringing together over 1,000 attendees from 18 countries to discuss and advance the state of neuroscience research, patient care, and delivery.
