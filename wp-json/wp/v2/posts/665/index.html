Her goal is to create a new model for research and funding, setting out to raise $50 million over the next year to help find treatments and cures for five conditions: multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s, Lou Gehrig\u2019s (ALS), Parkinson\u2019s, and brain tumors.<\/p>\n<p>The Romneys are seeding the center with what Ann calls a \u201csubstantial gift.\u201d And I trust that it is big.

She has lived for 16 years with MS, a chronic disease of the immune system in which nerves deteriorate, causing symptoms as severe as paralysis. Her doctor, Howard Weiner, is at the Brigham and the idea for a new center came two years ago following a routine visit.
