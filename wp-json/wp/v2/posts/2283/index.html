The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the changing economic cancer-care landscape.<\/p>\n<p>Novel, potentially curative cancer therapies are coming to market, with the promise of unprecedented patient benefits. While most key stakeholders have recognized the cost effectiveness of curative therapies, these therapies also present a challenge to payers in terms of the potential spike in patient volume and high cost as many of these innovative cancer therapies are being introduced. The \u201cCurative Therapies: The Economics of Game Changing Science\u201d panel will bring together top executives from the pharma, foundation, pharmacy, and provider sectors to explore cost effectiveness as part of regulatory approval. They will also examine the increasing emphasis on early detection, shifting incentives for oncologists, and how integrating billing codes, bundled payments, and management fees can help bring drug costs down. This panel will take place at 3:10 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.<\/p>\n<p>Panel participants include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moderator: Sue Siegel, CEO, GE Ventures and Healthymagination<\/li>\n<li>Troyan Brennan, MD, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, CVS<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>\u201cThe balance of affordability and the continuation of progress in the development of new drugs and therapies is an increasingly critical factor in cancer care and the way we treat cancer patients today,\u201d said Gary Reedy, CEO, American Cancer Society. \u201cThis forum will examine some of the emerging issues that directly impact that balance including the cost of new innovations, procedures, diagnostics and medications, changes in reimbursement, and new models of care delivery.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Health<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 2\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<ul>\n<li>Paul Hudson, President, AstraZeneca US and Executive Vice President, AstraZeneca North America<\/li>\n<li>Betsy Nabel, MD, President, BWH and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School<\/li>\n<li>Gary Reedy, Chief Executive Officer, American Cancer Society<\/li>\n<li>Peter Slavin, MD, President, MGH and Professor of Healthcare Policy, Harvard MedicalSchoolAccording to the American Cancer Society, cancer causes 1 in 7 deaths worldwide and is rapidly becoming a global epidemic.
