The 2016 Forum, an annual collaboration and partnering event held in Boston on April 25-27, will focus on cancer. CEOs and senior company executives, top investors, policy experts, and Harvard scientists leading the charge in the fight against cancer will take the stage over the course of the three-day Forum for a series of sessions that will critically examine the innovations in and evolution of cancer care.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTechnological advances in diagnostics are beginning to make it possible to detect cancer at the earliest stages of the disease when treatment may be most effective,\u201d said David Louis, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, Massachusetts General Hospital and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. \u201cHowever, there have been many barriers to making these innovative tests widely available to patients, including the need for more research and development to ensure accuracy, better guidance to speed the regulatory process and new models to support their value and reimbursement. This Forum provides a space for us to learn about these exciting new diagnostic technologies and to collaborate on the scientific and economic challenges that preventative strategies and early cancer detection bring about.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDetecting cancer as early as possible in the developmental stage will help both patients and hospitals in terms of prognosis with possible cure or therapy regimens before the cancer has spread. It will also help avoid the economic burden\u00a0typically associated with late-stage detection,\u201d said Massimo Loda, MD, Senior Pathologist, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital,\u00a0Principal Investigator,\u00a0Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School. \u201cThe technologies we are creating and pursuing are designed to detect and pursue cancer cells at the most vulnerable point in their development: the very beginning. The Forum will provide us with the opportunity to discuss those advances and learn of other new developments in a collaborative manner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The prevention of cancer and the development of new strategies to detect cancer precursors and early-stage malignancies when treatment may be most effective \u2013 clinically and financially \u2014 are critical research goals. The experts on the \u201c<b>Early Detection and Prevention of Cancer<\/b>\u201d panel will review powerful imaging modalities, single-cell analysis of the tumor microenvironment and next-generation cancer models. They will also discuss circulating tumor DNA testing to monitor response to treatment and emergence of cancer resistance\u2014with the objective of early cancer diagnosis before symptoms appear. The panel will take place at <b>4:50 p.m. on Monday, April 25, 2016, in the Novartis Ballroom of The Westin Copley Hotel.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Panel participants include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"bwlistitemmargb\">Moderator:\u00a0<b>David Louis<\/b>, MD, Pathologist-in-Chief, MGH and Benjamin Castleman Professor of Pathology, Harvard Medical School<\/li>\n<li class=\"bwlistitemmargb\"><b>Andy Chan<\/b>, MD, Program Director, Gastroenterology Training Program, MGH and Associate Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School<\/li>\n<li class=\"bwlistitemmargb\"><b>William Hait<\/b>, MD, PhD, Global Head, Janssen Research &amp; Development<\/li>\n<li class=\"bwlistitemmargb\"><b>Krishna Kumar<\/b>, CEO, Emerging Businesses, Philips<\/li>\n<li class=\"bwlistitemmargb\"><b>Massimo Loda<\/b>, MD, Senior Pathologist, Principal Investigator, BWH, Dana-Farber and Professor, Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cThe number of people diagnosed with cancer is continuing to grow at an astounding rate and while new treatment advances are enabling more and more of these patients to survive, there is an increasing need for innovative tools and resources to address the changing needs of patients, their families and the health care system,\u201d said Claire Thom, Pharm D, Senior Vice President, Global Oncology Development, Astellas.<\/p>\n<p>Extraordinary treatment advances have turned many cancers from apparent death sentences into manageable chronic illnesses with extraordinary consequences for the entire health care system. In the United States, there are approximately 14 million cancer survivors, up from just three million four decades earlier. Those survivors have unique care requirements, that will put enormous stress on the system and calling out for new technology solutions. A program, titled \u201c<b>Surviving Cancer: New Realities, New Needs<\/b>,\u201d will discuss those requirements and the technologies and approaches that can help monitor, guide, and connect patients.
